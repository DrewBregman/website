# Induced Dreams are the Key to AGI

Welcome to my first blog post on AI and Machine Learning. This field is not only fascinating but also rapidly evolving. It impacts everything from simple daily tasks to complex decisions in various sectors including healthcare, finance, and education.

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, involves creating computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include speech recognition, decision-making, visual perception, and language translation.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved through algorithms that adapt and learn from patterns of data.

I hope you find this overview intriguing and come back for more in-depth discussions!
