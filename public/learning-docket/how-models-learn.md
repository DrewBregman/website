# How Models Learn

Generally speaking, I know machine learning is a subset of AI. And I know that machine learning mostly uses supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning to create statistical models and algorithms around patterns in data. But, I don't really understand any of it. 
 
1. How does each learning method work?
2. How do you pick which method to use?
3. How are LLMs built?
