## Mechanisms of Economic Booms & Busts

The amount of wealth being generated is unimaginable, and technology is improving faster than it ever has. But I don't know what drives our economy to prosperity or what drives it to recession. I hear about inflation rates, productivity, times of war, times of peace, global trade, oil prices, and co. but I have no idea how it all connects or how to create the right mental model.

1. What drives economic prosperity?
2. What role does productivity play?
3. How do wealth gaps impact economics?
4. What drives economic recession?
5. What are the biggest drivers of economies?
6. What are the drivers of the US, India, China, Germany, and Japan?
7. What happens when the fed raises interest rates?
